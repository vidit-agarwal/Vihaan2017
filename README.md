Our Project is about BLOOD LOGISTICS. We are planning to use and integrate IOT i.e. Internet Of Things and BlockChain Technology to solve the problem of Blood Logistics including proper Blood Inventory Management& Transportation. In the Current scenario, the main problem faced by the organizations is to effectively deliver the blood to the required patients and the blood camps in time but due to many circumstances, it gets fail. We are planning to counter this problem by involving the top trending technologies in this health sector.

The objective of our hack is to develop a system that is capable of the track, monitor, verify and allocate Blood units to the required person, camp or any concerned organization. Our suggested system will be very beneficial for the society as it will resolve several issues like  :   
 i) Fraud in blood supply by the dealer  
ii)  blood contamination (for health purpose)   
iii)  centralized the blood circulation in the area   
iv)  Slower delivery in terms of communication and decision.  

Our Hack will try to solve all above-mentioned issues in an structured and organised software implementations.  

## Implementations:

### Tech used:
1) Node.js
1) MySQL
1) Android

### Model Working
1) Donor donates the blood and the collection agency will upload the person details, blood group, location of extraction.
1) Then the node will be created with unique ID for the packet.
1) That ID will be printed or added to the packet for identifiaction.
1) The collected blood units are transfered to the blood bank for futher checking of blood quality and fitness.
1) If the blood is not fit for trasfusion then the node is created with recipent indicating the blood not for transfution.
1) Fit blood is taken to the certain area nessecary.
1) IF the blood is transfused to recipient than another node will be generated with recipent details and transfused area name iddicating blood has been used.

### IoT work
1) IoT  is used for autaentication of donor and ID generation at blood donation camp.
1) IoT devices also check units and update the block chain.
1) At recipient id of recipient  will be checked and block chain will be updated again.
