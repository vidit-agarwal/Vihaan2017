Our Project is about BLOOD LOGISTICS. We are planning to use and integrate IOT i.e. Internet Of Things and BlockChain Technology to solve the problem of Blood Logistics including proper Blood Inventory Management& Transportation. In the Current scenario, the main problem faced by the organizations is to effectively deliver the blood to the required patients and the blood camps in time but due to many circumstances, it gets fail. We are planning to counter this problem by involving the top trending technologies in this health sector.

The objective of our hack is to develop a system that is capable of the track, monitor, verify and allocate Blood units to the required person, camp or any concerned organization. Our suggested system will be very beneficial for the society as it will resolve several issues like  :   
 i) Fraud in blood supply by the dealer  
ii)  blood contamination (for health purpose)   
iii)  centralized the blood circulation in the area   
iv)  Slower delivery in terms of communication and decision.  

Our Hack will try to solve all above-mentioned issues in an structured and organised software implementations  .
